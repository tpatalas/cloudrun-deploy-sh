# If the local machine is based on Apple silicon, such as Macbook M1, it is required to add

# NOTE:
# When environment variables are added to Google Cloud Run's environment, 
# they are only available at runtime and not during build time. However, 
# Next.js may require environment variables during build time. To address 
# this issue, build-time substitution can be used to temporarily hold the 
# substitution and get replaced with Google Cloud Run's environment variables 
# during deployment with deploy.sh.
# --
# It's important to note that environment variables defined in Google Secret 
# Manager are available at both build time and runtime, but they may not be 
# free to use.
#
# Set build-time arguments. Add BUILD_ prefix to your enviornment variable
ARG BUILD_HOSTNAME
# Set environment variables based on build-time arguments by adding GCR_ prefix
